# Fixtures - initial data set up automatically on dev environment startup
#
# Applied automatically by: ./bin/dev
# Run manually with: ./bin/dev fixtures
#
# Fixtures are applied in order. Each fixture type:
#   bucket  - Create a bucket
#   file    - Upload a file to a bucket
#   dir     - Create a directory in a bucket
#   share   - Share a bucket with a peer (role: owner/mirror)
#   publish - Publish a bucket (grant decryption to mirrors)
#   mv      - Move/rename a file or directory

- `/hello.txt` - A simple greeting
- `/docs/readme.md` - This file

## Sharing
This bucket is shared with:
- `_owner` node as **owner** (can read/write)
- `mirror` node as **mirror** (can sync, decrypt after publish)

# Node visibility:
#   - owner  (API:5002, GW:8081): Owns bucket, sees latest state
#   - _owner (API:5003, GW:8082): Owner share, sees latest state after sync
#   - mirror (API:5004, GW:8083): Mirror share, sees latest published state
#
# Each node runs separate API and gateway servers:
#   - API:     http://localhost:5002 (owner), 5003 (_owner), 5004 (mirror)
#   - Gateway: http://localhost:8081 (owner), 8082 (_owner), 8083 (mirror)

# Verify with:
#   ./bin/dev api owner ls <bucket_id> /docs
#   ./bin/dev api _owner ls <bucket_id> /docs
#   curl http://localhost:8083/gw/<bucket_id>/docs/hello.txt
